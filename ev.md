# Should you buy an EV?

## 1. Can you charge at home/work cheaply?
 
The main reason to buy an EV is that it’s cheaper to run than an ICE (internal combustion engine) car. However, this only applies if you can charge at home or work cheaply. If you can’t, then it’s likely to be more expensive than an ICE car.

This is because the cost of electricity varies significantly depending on where you charge your car. Charging at home or work is much cheaper than charging at public chargers. See the table below for a comparison of costs I have paid in June 2025.

Location | Home Economy 7 Night | Work Wholesale Price | Home Standard Tariff | Cheap Public Charger | Expensive Public Charger
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Electricity Cost | 7p/kWh | 13p/kWh | 26p/kWh | 50p/kWh | 87p/kWh
Cost per mile (3.33 mi /  kWh, 10% charger loss) | 2.3p/mi | 4.3p/mi | 8.6p/mi | 17p/mi | 29p/mi
Petrol or Diesel Equivalent (140p/gal) | 276 MPG | 149 MPG | 75 MPG | 39 MPG | 23 MPG

## 2. What are your longest journeys?

Recent EVs have [ranges greater than 300 miles](https://ev-database.org/uk/cheatsheet/range-electric-car), with real world ranges above 150 miles. This is more than enough for all sensible commutes. Journeys that are longer than this will require charging stops, which can take 10-15 minutes at ultra-rapid chargers.

Here's an example of a long journey in an EV:

This [180 mile journey](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=3b21756e-bfed-484a-b57b-c67edf5c156b) is too long for my Corsa e's 150 real world range, so it's split into two 90 mile legs with a 14 minute charging stop in the middle. Three hours is a long journey, so I'd want to stop for a break to stretch my legs, go to the toilet and get food or drink anyway.

With a 150 mile range, I can drive for 2-2.5 hours before needing a charge. EVs with larger batteries can drive for longer before needing a charge.

## 3. Charging on long journeys

Public EV chargers come in a variety of charging speeds, which change how long it takes to charge a car. On long journeys rapid (50 kW+) to ultra-rapid (150 kW+) are used, which can charge some models to 85% in 10-15 minutes. It's typical to charge to 85% as charging slows down significantly as the battery approaches full. Chargers are often located near coffee shops, fast food or supermarkets so there’s something to do while charging. The time taken to charge a 50 kWh EV with different chargers is shown below:

Charger Type | Charging Rate | 10% to 85% Charge Time
--- | --- | ---
Rapid | 50 kW | 45 minutes
Rapid | 100 kW | 23 minutes
Ultra-rapid | 150 kW | 15 minutes

The maximum charging rate also depends on the car, so is a key differentiator for long journeys. 

The public charging network is extensive, with most of the UK covered. 
[Zapmap](https://www.zap-map.com/live/) shows the locations of public chargers, their charging speeds, costs and whether they are in use. By default it shows slow chargers, but you can filter to show rapid (purple) and ultra-rapid chargers (pink), as shown below.

On the long jouurney example, there's several chargers on the A303 around halfway through the journey at Andover or Amesbury.

## 4. Charging at home/work

There's a few options for charging at home/work depending on how much you drive and how much you want to spend on charging equipment. You may not need to spend £500-£1000 to install a wallbox charger if you don't drive much. 

Option | Granny Charger | Home Wallbox | Granny Charger | Home Wallbox
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Charging Period | Overnight | Overnight | After Work | After Work
Charging Period | 5-7 hours | 5-7 hours | 12+ hours | 12+ hours
Charging Rate | 2.3 kW | 7 kW | 2.3 kW | 7 kW
Initial Cost | £0* | £500-£1000 | £0* | £500-£1000
Energy Charged | 16 kWh | 50 kWh | 27.6 kWh | 84 kWh
Miles per  kWh | 3.33 | 3.33 | 3.33 | 3.33
Miles Charged | 53 miles | 166 miles | 92 miles | 280 miles
Electricity Cost | £1.12 | £3.50 | £3.99 | £5.88
Electricity Cost per Mile | 2.1p | 2.1p | 4.3p | 2.1p

`*` You'll want to buy a granny charger regardless, so you can charge when away from home at friends/family's houses to avoid using public chargers.


## Summary

If you can charge at home/work cheaply it’ll be cheaper than ICE, otherwise it’ll be more expensive and less convenient.

Rapid and Ultra-rapid chargers make long journeys feasible, with most of the UK covered by the public charging network.
