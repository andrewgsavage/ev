Should you buy an EV?

## 1. Can you charge at home cheaply?

Suits 99% of journeys for 99% of people; 99% of UK journeys are <100 mi

If you can charge at home/work cheaply it’ll be cheaper than ICE, otherwise it’ll be more expensive and less convenient.

Recent EVs have real world ranges of 200 - 250 miles so are suitable for all sensible commutes. Long journeys require stops at charging points. Try planning a route with https://abetterrouteplanner.com/

The charging network is extensive, with most of the UK covered. See https://www.zap-map.com/live/

Public EV chargers come in a variety of charging speeds, which change how long it takes to charge a car. On long journeys rapid (50kW+) to ultra-rapid (150kW+) are used, which can charge some models to 80% in 10-15 minutes. Chargers are often located near coffee, fast food or supermarkets so there’s something to do while charging.



Public EV chargers vary in charging rate, from slow (3kW-7kW), fast (22kW), rapid (50kW - 149kW) to ultra-rapid (150kW and above). The higher the charging rate, the faster the battery will charge - if the car is capable of charging that fast.
